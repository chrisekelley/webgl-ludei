# webgl-ludei

This is a copy of the CocoonJS [WebGL demo](http://storage.cocoonjsservice.ludei.com/demos/web_demos/webgl_demo/index.html)
to test the  CocoonJS cloud service in the Android CocoonJS player.

Note: WebGL is not yet enabled for the player so it does not work.

To test, use npm to install http-server (or use whatever server you prefer) and point it to this directory:

    http-server webgl-ludei
